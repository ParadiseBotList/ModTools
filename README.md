## What is ModTools?

Automod-discord is a bot that provides automoderation capabilities. It uses the [Toxicity classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity) by Tensorflow to automatically detect toxic messages.

The bot is highly configurable. You can specify what punishment a user should recieve after x amount of toxic messages. e.g. Deleting every toxic message and muting a user after every 5 toxic messages.
